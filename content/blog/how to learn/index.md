We don't stop learning when we leave school. In fact, we learn more after school than during school. That rings especially true for those working in tech. The amount of information we get barraged with in tech can be overwhelming. Here, I'll highlight the different techniques I've picked up over the years to better grasp new concepts. These techniques can be applied outside of tech.

### Seting The Tone

You must approach learning the same way an athlete approaches his or her sport. Proper eating, practice, and rest are all very important to absorbing knowledge efficiently. You can't learn when you're feeding your body with junk. You can't learn when you don't practice what you've learned. You can't learn when you're not getting adequate sleep.

### Basic Tips

#### Set an Objective

Set an objective when you're about to learn something new. A navigator without a compass will end up getting lost. Same thing with learning. Set an objective and follow it. Be agile with your objective, if you have to learn something new before reaching the ultimate objective then adjust your route.

#### Understand the Concept - Don't Memorize

You MUST understand every line of code that you write. If you don't understand why a piece of code is there then question it. Google it. Figure out WHY!

There is no shame in googling something. Every person I've worked with still use Google, StackOverflow, and other references to figure out the **_why_** behind code they don't understand. You're doing yourself and any person you work with a huge disservice by not understanding the code that you write.

Don't memorize code. If you understand the concept then you can recreate it. Memorization is a byproduct of practice, **_not_** an objective of the learning process.

#### Mental Models

It's very difficult to learn something new without referencing it with something you already know. Learn about mental models and apply them to your discretion as you come across new concepts and problems that you have a difficult time tackling.

[Here is a great blog by Julian Shapiro on Mental Models](https://www.julian.com/blog/mental-model-examples)

Analogies fall under the same umbrella as mental models. It's often very difficult to explain to someone what life is. But, if you explain it with the simple analogy of "life is a journey" then it becomes easier to grasp the complexity that is life itself.

When I was learning JS I signed up to Dan Abramov's [Just JavaScript](https://justjavascript.com/) newsletter. In JustJS, Dan Abramov uses outer space as an analogy for the JavaScript universe. Go check it out!

#### Tutorials

Be wary of tutorial hell. Any dumbass (sorry) can follow along a tutorial and parrot the code in front of them. Don't be a dumbass. Yes, follow the tutorial, but, don't blindly follow it. Understand why the code is being written and how it works. Once the tutorial is done, add something new. See a line of code that is being repeated? Write a function and refactor the tutorial code.

Push beyond you're comfort zone. Make progress every time you sit down to learn, it doesn't matter how little progress you make. Progress is progress.

#### Repetition - Perfect Practice Makes Perfect

Remember when I said you can apply these techniques outside of tech? Well I learned this one from basketball - perfect practice makes perfect. If you're coding and naming each variable x, y, or z then you're not practicing right. You will not get hired if you name your variables with alphabets. Practice good coding habits when you're learning so that you can fit seamlessly into a professional environment.

When I was learning JavaScript, I frequently referenced [the Google JS style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html) to make sure that I was following the industry standards on writing JS.

If you're following a tutorial and you don't understand a part then repeat it. Didn't understand it again? Well, repeat it again!

#### Learning Techniques

There's a lot of information out there about different learning techniques so I'll share with you the ones that I use. It may or may not work for you. If you have or find a different technique that works for you then stick to that method.

My technique is the Pomodoro technique. Here's how it goes:

- Set a timer to 25 minutes and focus on learning for 25 minutes
- 5 minute breaks in between the 25 minute block
- Rinse and Repeat

You will inevitably find yourself getting distracted during the 25 minute focus time. When you get distracted, write down the distracting thought and visit it during the 5 minute breaks.

Here is the link to the [pomodoro timer that I use](https://tomato-timer.com/).

I aim for a minimum three 25 minute blocks every day because of [Ben Franklin's rule](https://www.ucf.edu/news/new-goal-follow-ben-franklins-plan-spend-1-hour-day-learn-something/) to set aside 1 hour a day to learning.

### Closing Thoughts

If you're like me, then you'll find yourself suffering from [imposter syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) at some point in your career.

[Here is a video of Googlers and how they overcame impostor syndrome](https://youtu.be/pIvWpLgNWPA)

And now I present to you this week's closing quote...
