### Setting Expectations

I don't really know why I'm starting this blog. Heck, I don't know if I'll continue writing beyond this first post. But, I do know that I want to document my journey in the programming world so that I can look back and see my growth...hopefully.

I'm not a writer by trade, nor was I a good writer when I was in school. I'm sure there'll be plenty of grammar mistakes in this blog but I'll do my best to proofread before posting.

### What I'll Write About

I've been reading about the Feynman Technique for learning. Essentially, it's a way of learning by taking what you learn and simplifying it so that you can teach it to someone with little or no experience. One of the goals of this blog will be to act as a reference point for the things that I've learn and the mistakes that I've committed. Learning in tech is so fast paced that it's often difficult to hold on to knowledge. By having this blog, I'll be able to contain my thoughts so that I can reference it in the future. Yes, I can write this for my own private reading but I figured that if it helps me then maybe it can help others too.

In addition, I may ocassionally post about something non-tech related but may be useful in other ways. It may be about philosophy, self-motivation, setting goals, etc...

### Closing Thoughts

Language is beautiful and there are a lot of people out there who can articulate my thoughts better than me. I'll sprinkle these quotes throughout my blogs. These quotes may be motivational, thought provoking, humorous, or straight up random in nature. Hopefully, the following quote inspires you the way that it has inspired me.

> "If you imagine less, less will be what you undoubtedly deserve. Do what you love, and don’t stop until you get what you love. Work as hard as you can, imagine immensities, don’t compromise, and don’t waste time. Start now. Not 20 years from now, not two weeks from now. Now." - [Debbie Millman](https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/05/15/debbie-millman-look-both-ways-fail-safe/)

This blog was created using [Leonid's Starter](https://github.com/renyuanz/leonids).
The plan was to create a blog from scratch but I wanted to get my thoughts out before I lose 'em.

I stumbled upon the Debbie Millman quote while reading [Maria Popova's brainpickings blog](https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/05/15/debbie-millman-look-both-ways-fail-safe/).
